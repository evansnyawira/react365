# Introduction

in this folder, we have our basic server setup together with our react project files ready(at least enough for us to see some react at work) to render three dots(which am told it a good way to start our project and maybe test thing).

### Server option ..... more options .... options everywhere(ps using that Buzz Lightyear meme)
With [Express](http://expressjs.com/) there are a million ways to render your content(HTML) in our project I commented out a way to render with pug a very popular render engine(which solves various DOM render, etc. problems and in away corrects our bad habits of writing poor HTML ). for some reason I opted to serve our page statically(because I can... unless given a good reason not to start there). all in all, there are more view engines servers and such to help you work better with react, so I advise you to explore your options, eg. [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

### Webpack and Wabel
We use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle our react.js into a single file using [webpack.config.js](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/) file among other things you should learn from the links. As for [babel](https://babeljs.io/) see what it does in the documentation.

# Take your time. I will mine
Make a point of reading the [REACT](https://reactjs.org/) documentation and try to understand at least some concepts about react before taking on tasks. Its always helpful to know what react is and maybe you might find it's not the library for you (rarely, the possibilities are limitless especially when combined with React Native). In my opinion, react gives you a broader platform to learn new javascript features as much as any other platform.

### How to set up ...
It might be of great value to read more on setting up a react development environment from the react dev tools in your favorite browser to learning the difference between the development and production environments, error handling among other things. You will also find other resources that come in handy in a development environment like your text editor of choice when it comes to your preference( i prefer vscode and atom they give me the joy of wringing code). Before I forget its good to lear how to setup tools like [eslint](https://eslint.org/) or their alternatives(they not only help you write great code but also help to become a better coder over time). It's good to avoid small errors by using a linter of choice. It also helps when you have a linter that helps write code that is standard based on rules from the various choices available using the following command.


```
//I used .gitignore to commit my files so that you can configure your linters as desired
eslint --init

```

# Recommendations
There are great choices of books out there to choose from as guides when learning any new technology. My books of choice for this program are as follows and will be updated on the main [README]() file with the addition of every new chapter available and the topic of choice.
