# Reactjs 365
## Introduction
This repository in a journal to track my self-taught self-paced learning of Reactjs, relay, redux, graphQL and MongoDB for the next year(or through 2018(and beyond) hopefully I will journal everything in my free time(hope so). I will categorize everything using a chaptered system, and maybe I will be able to keep up with myself to learn everything there is to learn about Reactjs and the others(while listening to some house(deep house maybe) techno).

## In The Beginning

So first you need some background on Nodejs MongoDB and javascript(obviously) luckily for me I have them installed on my Debian(Debian 9) system (the latest versions of them all!). I have been learning javascript on the Node REPL for three years now(tonnes of exciting things to learn you can start here [jscomplete](https://jscomplete.com/) or go to their repository at [jscomplete](https://github.com/jscomplete) (i will be a frequent of these sites just to make sure am doing everything like everyone else)

## Prerequisite

generally if for some reason you need to walk with me you need to start by going through the documentation of the said technologies or run
the following commands to install the prerequisite modules

### Make your directories....
```
mdir super-awesome-project-name
cd super-awesome-project-name
```

### make subdirectories


```
mdir start-here-name
cd start-here-name

````

Initialize with a package.json file to keep track of your dependencies and other stuff
yarn users like me, ( see the advantages of yarn at their website, you will thank me later)
#### using yarn
```
yarn init

```
#### using npm

```
npm init

```

### now that you have answered the questions asked
To the best of your interest(about the licenses it useful to learn about them at least most of them for a better understanding of which to use).now that you have experienced a command line program maybe its time you looked into that.Next, we install the dependencies I will be using yarn full stop! for various reasons 


####  we start with the dependencies for a react  related project and the beginning of our project
```
yarn add react react-dom express 

```
#### next we install the development dependecies
```
yarn add --dev webpack babel-cli babel-preset-env babel-preset-react 
```

that's all, for now, we can soon start to get our hands dirty 

# setting up the project 
use the start-here readme for the intoductory part of this project
