# Reactjs 365
This repository in a journal to track my self-taught self-paced learning of Reactjs, relay, redux, graphQL and MongoDB for the next year(or through 2018(and beyond) hopefully I will journal everything in my free time(hope so). I will categorize everything using a chaptered system, and maybe I will be able to keep up with myself to learn everything there is to learn about Reactjs and the others(while listening to some house(deep house maybe) techno).

# In The Beginning

So first you need some background on Nodejs MongoDB and javascript(obviously) luckily for me I have them installed on my Debian(Debian 9) system (the latest versions of them all!). I have been learning javascript on the Node REPL for three years now(tonnes of exciting things to learn you can start here https://jscomplete.com/ or go to their repository at https://github.com/jscomplete (i will be a frequent of these sites just to make sure am doing everything like everyone else)
